Introduction
------------
This lightweight framework is made to maximize developer efficiency by introducing an intuitive workflow on top of a solid front-end architecture. You will be focusing on user interaction building without distraction. We even give you a full-featured *Javascript* web server as a reference implementation on the RESTful and Websocket services to start the development right away! Theming and packaging deployments are also a breeze through our tools.

**Tip:** Keep your *JavaScript* codes flat and *HTML* dynamic, style through *CSS* class.

### Core concepts

![Stage.js Architecture](static/resource/default/diagram/Diagram-3.png)

!!!callout callout-info
**Remember:** Your goal is to
* Create view objects with HTML template and actions. 
* Link them into pre-defined regions. 
* Help them talk to each other through collaboration events.
* Navigate through them as groups or individually by regions.
!!!

#### What's a View?

A *View* is a template with data, interactions and optionally a name. it is to be shown on a region in template of your application or another view instance. Only named views can be used as template shortcuts (through anonymous region tag attribute `view="..."`) or put into the navigation chain URI (e.g `#navigate/Context/LvlOneSubView/LvlTwoSubView...`).

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** As in v1.8+ We have merged the old *Regional* concept with *View* in general. Future releases will not distinguish between *Regional*s and named *View*s.
!!!

The **Context** concept is Deprecated.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** As in v1.9+ We have merged the old *Context* concept with *View* in general. Future releases will not distinguish between *Context*s and named *View*s. The first-level views demanded by the navigation chain (#hash path) will automatically be treated as a *Context*. The `guard` function will be triggered if presented.
!!!

#### What's an Editor?

An *Editor* is a named *View* with `.setVal()`, `.getVal()`, `.validate()`, `.status()` and `.enable()/.disable()/.isEnabled()` methods that caches its value through `<input>`,`<select>`and`<textarea>` contained in the template. Your *Editor* can have sub-views but the APIs required are not chained automatically.

#### What's a Widget?

A *Widget* is a named *View* with `.reconfigure(options)` method that can change its layout and functional parts without a full re-creation of the *Widget*. A great example would be the **DataGrid** widget released as an bonus component with the framework together with **Tree** and **Paginator**.

#### What's a SVG canvas?

An SVG canvas is a *View* with the `.svg` property set to `true`, you will have an automatically expanded `this.paper` to draw upon with live height/width update on the `this.paper` property after shown plus auto clean/resize upon view `ready`. 

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** *Canvas* is svg based and the `this.paper` drawing APIs are from the RaphaÃ«l.js/Snap.svg library, make sure you have one of them included.
!!!

We have not yet included support for *HTML5 Canvas*.

#### What's Navigation?

We achieve client-side multi-page-alike navigation through switching *View*s on a pre-defined application region in respond to the URL hash fragment change event. You can also keep navigating beyond the first level *View*s by chaining view names in the hash. (e.g `#navigate/Context/LvlOneSubView/LvlTwoSubView...`)

Those named views can set their `navRegion` properties to honor the navigation path by recursively presenting required views into their `navRegion`s. Without the `navRegion` you will also get a special event param (path) triggered to the `navigateTo` event on the view. Leaving you full flexibility on interpreting the rest of the path yourself. This unique navigation mechanism enables endless possibilities in combining views in hierarchies dynamically just through URI changes.

#### RESTful / Websocket data handling?

Modern web application generates views according to user data dynamically. This is why we picked *Backbone* as our view engine base. However, the way we handle remote data in the framework is a bit different than the original design in *Backbone*.

Since most of the application state comes from the server, managing locally cached data can backfire badly if your design requirement is vague (like in most of the prototyping phase, right?). You are advised to make the data interfacing/manipulation layer as thin as possible. Operate on plain data object/array as much as possible. (e.g Bind pagination, sorting and filtering as view actions/listeners instead of Collection methods, unless you have a requirement to operate on locally cached data)

!!!callout callout-warning
**Important:** We introduce a unified *DATA API* for handling all the in/out of remote server data, skipping the *Model/Collection* centered way of data manipulation. They are still created internally for you however. But *you will only need `view.set()/get()/more()/refresh()` and the `view.data` attribute* to use them.
!!!

Remember, Model/Collection are only used as dumb data snapshot object on the client side to support views. The goal is to make the data interfacing layer *as thin as possible*. You will find more details in the **Quickstart/Handling Data** section.

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** You can also use `app.poll()` for Ajax based api polling periodically or `app.ws().then()` for Websocket based realtime server-push messaging. Both data operations offer cleanly defined global coop events for you to hook up listeners inside a view.
!!!

#### Reuse view definitions?

For views that you need to use again and again but with different configuration/options (e.g a Datagrid), register it as a *Widget* or, in case of a basic input, an *Editor*. These reusable view definitions are called *Reusable*s in the framework. Think in terms of the **List and Container** (further down this document) technique as much as possible when creating them.

#### Co-op through events

We encourage event programming in this framework. We glue views into a functioning whole by using meta-events. Whenever an interaction or transition happens (e.g navigation, context-swap, login, error, data-ready...), instead of calling the actual *doer*s, **fire/trigger an event first and provide a default listener**, so that later the actual behavior triggered by this event can be changed without affecting the glue/interfacing logic. Read carefully through the **Events** subsection in **Basics** below so you understand how to implement and extend application behaviors mainly through events. 

#### User actions

Use of `action=` and `action-<*>=` in the templates can automatically generate events to trigger your *View* functions registered by `.actions` property. From within the functions, it is very easy to grab the DOM element invloved in the action and `this` bind to the *View*. You can put data ids as metadata attributes (`data-*=` then `$actionEl.data(*)`) on the `action=` tagged elements to ease your data management or craft unique operation routines.

#### Application locking

Sometimes, with Ajax or other asynchronized operations (like timer related ones), you might need to disable the application's ability to navigate through views or respond to certain events/actions. We have a very neat locking module for you to use in just those situations. The 2-level locking design allows you to decide when to use the global lock or the topic based ones to maximize your control over the availability of UIs.

#### Seems complicated...

To focus, think of your application in terms *View*s (pages and areas). Like drawing a series of pictures, each page is a *View* and you lay things out by sketching out regions (areas) first on each page then gradually refine the regional sub *View* details. Each *View* can also be made state-aware through the navigation notifying mechanism that powers the entire application container.

!!!callout callout-info
**Remember:** The goal of this framework is to keep you focused on building dynamic views without worrying about linking or organizing them into a manageable whole. It is very important that you understand the *region*, *navigation* and *event* concepts. So that you can maximize the efficiency offered by our unique workflow.
!!!

### Why not using...

Why not using AngularJS/EmberJS/Meteor or YUI/ExtJS? Yes you can, but, if you can, **always favor libraries over frameworks**. Given that *Stage.js* is also a framework. The advise here should be extended to: 
> If you can *NOT* agree with the workflow/abstraction, always favor libraries over frameworks.

We choose what we choose when designing this framework simply because we want total control over our product. There are often 2 types of framework to choose from when developing a web application:
* Development Framework - AngularJS/EmberJS/Meteor (infrastructure only)
* Application Framework (All-in-One) - YUI/ExtJS (infrastructure plus widgets and tools)

!!!callout callout-warning
**Important:** There is no mentioning of **React.js**, **Vue.js** or **Ractive.js** because these are view engine libraries instead of frameworks. Put it this way, it is like having a `Backbone.View` but with the `.init() and .render()` implemented already together with `ui:{}` pre-defined and pre-wired. Don't confuse yourself with the concepts.
!!!

**The Backbone library can implement them all** (Yes, any client side framework). (Not 100% for Meteor though, since Meteor combines its server into a full-stack solution. You need nodejs in the picture, and we do have a dev-server package called **ajax-box-lite** in the toolset for just that based on the [express.js](http://expressjs.com/4x/) framework). And, if you need more evidence, YUI3 has the exact same concepts from Backbone implemented as its infrastructure. (Why did we mention YUI here? Because of Yahoo!'s JavaScript [Architect](http://www.crockford.com/))

In order to accomplish more with less code using Backbone, we extended **Backbone.Marionette** (a pattern library) and reusing its *region* concepts for view nesting. However, you do NOT need to read their documentation before using **Stage.js** neither do you need to be familiar with the different types of views required by that library. There is only one general **View** concept here. We also removed the needs to work directly with the Model/Collection methods in the original *Backbone* library when building views. The resulting framework accomplishes all the big frameworks have promised but with **a thiner and flattened structure**. We believe scripting languages are always going to be the perfect thin glue layer between mechanisms and policies. The JavaScript language were picked to glue HTML/CSS and UX but nothing more, it should not be overdosed and attempt to mimic something bloated like Java. In other words, **only the burger is important**:

![HTML is the burger](static/resource/default/diagram/Diagram-6.png)

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Although the **Marionette** library offers many cool concepts for building large JavaScript front-end projects, we felt that the core value it offers lies within its region (for better view life-cycle management) and module managers. Thus only those are included and supported throughout the framework. We also extended the base view classes to enable remote templating, automatic ui and region detection, action listeners, navigation hooks, svg canvas and faster **Cordova** development. 
!!!

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** The **JQuery UI** library contained in this framework is a custom build (Core, Interaction and Effect). It is sufficient for you to create plugins and widgets and to use the `$.fn.position()` and `$.fn.animation()` methods. However, you will *NOT* be able to use any UIs in the original library.
!!!

And one last thing, NO, you don't need ES6 with babel or coffeescript/typescript or any syntax shiv/sugar or npm with browserify to start building your web application. Just `bower` and ES5 with Stage.js would do the job! If you prefer server side Javascript for the middleware, then by all means use ES6 with the latest Node.js runtime there (We recommend against using Javascript on the server side due to the limit of the language in var scope guarding and debugging). Also, unless you want to obsecure your code before deployment, you really don't need grunt/gulp/webpack for a full-blown build process setup to develop your application. 

Still, we provide RESTful and websocket middleware, build and theme automation in the framework.

Basics
------
Although not required, some familiarities of the following Javascript libraries would greatly help while using the framework:

* Underscore.js/Lo-Dash *(handy js functional helpers)*
* jQuery/Zepto *(DOM manipulation through CSS selectors)*
* Handlebars.js *(dynamic templates)*

If you don't know what they are, go for a quick look at their websites.

We also maintain a list of 3rd party libraries for the developers to choose from in addition to the base libraries. These utility libraries (e.g jquery-file-upload, store.js, uri.js, marked, moment.js, ...) are carefully selected from the many open-source JavaScript libraries out there to help with specific but generally-will-appear problems that a developer will encounter during the web application development process. (see more in the **Include other js libraries** section)

### Choose the right distribution

#### Project kit

> * /implementation -- your web root
>   * /js (-)
>   * /static (-)
>   * /themes
>   * index.html
>   * bower.json
> * /tools
>   * /build -- minify and concatenate your js files by scanning index.html
>   * /themeprep -- prepare your theme with textures, fonts and icons
>   * /devserver -- development web server with less file monitor
>   * /shared -- shared scripts used by the tools
>   * package.json

**(-)**: This folder is empty initially, it is created as a suggestion.

Use the project-kit distribution whenever you want to start a production level web application project.

#### Release pack

> * /js
>     - /lib
>         + dependencies.min.js
>         + dependencies.json
>     - stage.js
>     - stage.min.js
> * CHANGELOG.md
> * LICENSE
> * README.md

This distribution is designed to be simple and doesn't have tools and theme packages for production level development. The release-pack folder is serve-able out of the box.

Use the release-pack distribution for prototyping your next product concept, or to keep your project core up-to-date.

The release-pack distribution is also what you will get from the bower package manager when using command:
```
bower install/update stage
```

### Quickstart

Here is the recommended **workflow**. You should follow the steps each time you want to start a new project with *Stage.js*.

#### Preparation

##### Create new project

1. Install the [`stage-devtools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stage-devtools) from `npm`:
```
npm -g install stage-devtools
```
2. Check your development environment:
```
stagejs env
```
If you see missing command-line tools marked with `*required`, have them installed before moving on. See our [Environment Prep Guide](https://github.com/bluekvirus/Stage-devtools/blob/master/ENV.md).
3. Under an empty folder run:
```
stagejs init
stagejs theme [--fonts ...]
```
4. [optional] Update everything with the latest edge version:
```
stagejs update [--edge]
```
5. Start the development server
```
stagejs serve [--port <number>]
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** It is recommended that you use the theme preparation tool to create a new theme before you continue to develop your project. This way, whenever the basic (default) theme updates, you can upgrade to it easily.
!!!

You can now use the `stagejs` command-line to create all the element needed in your application. Use the following cmd to see what you can create from the command-line:
```
stagejs create -l
```

Read more about the `stagejs` [cli tool](https://github.com/bluekvirus/Stage-devtools).

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** Use our development [**VM through Vagrant**](https://github.com/bluekvirus/vm-webdev) if you don't want to bother with setting up your own environment. Run the `stagejs` command-line tool inside this VM once it is up and running.
!!!

##### Revive existing project

Under your project folder, open up a console/terminal on your OS and do the following:
1. Revive the project libs
```
stagejs update [-e]
```
2. Re-compile the theme
```
stagejs theme [project]
```
3. Start the devserver
```
stagejs serve [5000]
```

!!!callout callout-info
**Remember:** Creating a web application is like drawing a picture. Start by laying things out and gradually refine the details. In our case, always start by defining the templates.
!!!

Now, let's start building a real web application.

#### Step 1. Initialize

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** You can use `stage.js` instead of `stage.min.js` in `index.html` to have better debugging info.
!!!

##### Configure

Go to your `main.js` and setup the application by using `Application.setup()`:
``` 
//main.js
Application.setup({
    /*----------------------configure-----------------------*/
    fullScreen: //false | true,
    curtains: //fixed overlay regions,
    defaultView: //your default context name to show in navRegion,
    baseAjaxURI: //your base url for using with Application.remote(),
    websockets: //websocket paths to initialize,
    viewSrcs: //view dynamic loading base path.
    i18nTransFile: //the translation file name/pattern under i18nResources,
    i18nLocale: //force the app to certain locale,
    rapidEventDelay: //for throttling window resize/scroll and app.throttle/debounce,
    timeout: //default data (ajax) operation timeout in ms,
    /*----------------------mainView-----------------------*/
    template: //same as view template property,
    layout: //same as view layout property, (if not using template)
    navRegion: //your region used for navigation chain,
    data: //same as view data property,
    actions: //same as view actions property,
}).run();
```
The configure variables have sensible defaults, you can safely skip configuring them here, however, there is one you might want to change now -- `template`.

You can re-configure the `baseAjaxURI` and `viewTemplates` later by invoking the `Application.setup()` method again:
```
//main-type-desktop.js
Application.setup({
    viewTemplates: 'static/template/desktop'
}).run();

//main-type-mobile.js
Application.setup({
    viewTemplates: 'static/template/mobile'
});
```

Since your goal is to build a multi-view application, you will need some *regions* in the application template and a *Navigation Region*:
```javascript
//main.js
Application.setup({
    ...
    template: [
        '<div view="Banner"></div>',
        '<div region="body"></div>',
        '<div region="footer"></div>'
    ],
    navRegion: 'body', //use region 'body' as the navigation region
    ...
}).run();
```
A `region=""` attribute on any html tag marks a pre-defined region in the template, **you can do this within any *View*** template. Doing so is equivalent of using the `regions:{}` property.

Tag marked with `region=""` can use an additional `view=""` attribute to load up a *View* / *Widget* or *@remote.template.html* by name:
```
'<div region="banner" view="Banner"></div>'

//is equivalent to

onReady: function(){
    this.show('banner', 'Banner');
    //or
    this.getRegion('banner').show(new Application.get('Banner'));
}
```

!!!callout callout-warning
**Important:** Views loaded by the `view=""` attribute should have no init options. If you do need to specify init options when showing a view, use the alternative `region:load-view` event or `view.show('region', View)` api.
!!!

If your application is a one-view application, you don't need to assign the application template. There will always be a region that wraps the whole application -- the *app* region. The **Default** view will automatically show on region *app* if you did not specify `navRegion` and `defaultView`.

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** You can omit `region=""` if that region is not needed in your application later to show other views.
!!!

##### Run

```
Application.setup({...}).run();
```
If you are using Stage.js in a hybrid app (cordova/phonegap), use this to kickstart the app:
```
Application.setup({...}).run(true);
//or
Application.setup({...}).run('deviceready'); //hook on specified ready event
```
Note that the ready event may vary in different hybrid app development package.

##### Customized bootstrapping

The application bootstrapping sequence can be modified, you can add your own environment preparation code as initializers:
```
Application.addInitializer(function(options){
    //go to check user's session
    return app.remote('api/v1/user/touch').done(...);
});
Application.addInitializer(function(options){
   //...anything sync or async(return a promise)...
});
...

Application.run();
```

Plus the events we put in after running your initializers:
```
app:before-mainview-ready //fired before the application is shown
app:mainview-ready //fired after the application is shown
```

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** You can swap application template using the `Application.setup()` call upon receiving the `app:before-mainview-ready` event to configure/layout your application differently on different platforms. (Use the `Modernizr` global variable for platform/feature detections.)
!!!

Let's proceed to define your top-level views so you have something to show after the application starts.

#### Step 2. Define Contexts

Create a new file named `myContextA.js`, remember a *Context* is just an special view object with additional special methods/listeners:
```
//myContextA.js
(function(app) {
    app.view('MyContextA', { //omitting the name indicates context:Default
        template: '...',
        guard: function(){
            //return error ('string') to cancel navigation;
            //return nothing ('', false, undefined) to proceed;
        },
        //listeners: (after guard)
        onBeforeNavigateTo: function(){
            //do something before navigation. 
        },
        onNavigateTo: function(path){
            //path == '', undefined means the navigation stopped here.
        },
        onNavigateAway: function(){
            //... 
            //if you want to save context status (through localStorage maybe)
        }
    });
})(Application);
```
alias: `Application.page()`. 

##### Template

When defining template for a view you can use one of the four ways we support:

* \#id -- local html template by DOM id;
* @\*\*/\*.html -- remote html templates;
* 'html string' -- single line html string;
* ['html str1', 'html str2', ...] -- array of html strings;

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** To enable remote template support, you need to configure `viewTemplates` through `Application.setup()`.
!!!

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Remote view templates will only be fetched once and then cached and reused within the client side application. Additional view instances using the same remote template will not trigger another loading process.
!!!

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Remote templates should be combined into a single `all.json` file before going into production deployment. This is already supported by our build tool. Check your build configure file to enable this auto processing. You don *NOT* need to care about this `all.json` file. It is automatically loaded once you've set the `viewTemplates` configure.
!!!

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** Combine remote templating with IDE tool (ZenCoding/(Emmet)[http://emmet.io]) will greatly improve your development speed.
!!!

##### Navigate between Views

Use api or the `app:navigate` event on `Application` to actively switch between views.
```
//full path mode A: api
Application.navigate('ABC/EFG/...');

//full path mode B: event
Application.trigger('app:navigate', 'ABC/EFG/...');

//context, module/subpath mode
Application.trigger({
    context: 'ABC',
    subpath: 'EFG/...', //alias: module
});
```
You can also use the clicking event on an `<a>` anchor tag to switch view without any code involved:
```
<a href="#navigate/ABC/EFG/..."></a>
```
Or, brutally using the actual `window.location` object:
```
window.location.hash = '#navigate/ABC/EFG/...';
```

There is an `navigate-away` event triggered to call `onNavigateAway` method on a context when the application is switching away from one. Use this listener if you want to store some of the context state and recover later. We recommend that you use the localStorage feature of HTML5 and we have already include a library for you in the framework distribution. (see [store.js](https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js) for more)

You can pass an additional *silent* argument with the `app:navigate` event to avoid changing the url hash path during the navigation:
```
Application.trigger('app:navigate', {
    context: context, //optional
    subpath: subpath //omitting context will append subpath to current context
}, true);
//or
Application.trigger('app:navigate', 'path string...', true);
```

If you defined a `guard` function as property in one of your contexts, it will be called before the context gets switched to. If the `guard` function returns an error, `app:context-guard-error` will get triggered on the `Application` object with the returned error and context name. You can use this mechanism to guard your contexts from unauthenticated users and automatically jump to a pre-defined login context. 
```
(function(app){

    app.view('AccessDenied', {
        template: '...',
        guard: function(){
            
            //block access
            return {
                msg: 'You are not allowed to see this context',
                target: this
            };

            //or to signal passing of this guard simply return nothing
            return;
        }
    });

    //the default guard error listener for Application
    app.onContextGuardError = function(error, ctxName){
        console.error('DEV:Context-Guard-Error:', ctxName, error);
    };

})(Application);
```

##### Navigate beyond a Context

When the navigation is at `#navigate/MyContextA/SubViewA/SubViewB...` the router finds `navRegion` in `MyContextA` and shows `SubViewA` in it and then move on to `SubViewA` to show `SubViewB...` in its `navRegion`. If, somehow, it can not find the definition of `SubViewA`, the navigation stops on `MyContextA` and triggers `view:navigate-to` event with the remaining subpath starting with `SubViewA/...` on `MyContextA`. The same process happens on `SubViewA` if the router can not find `SubViewB...`.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** All named Views can all appear in the navigation path if they have the `navRegion` property defined.
!!!

You will learn how to create *View*s in the next section.

#### Step 3. Views

Before continue, change your `myContextA.js` into `/context-a/index.js` so you can start adding regional view definitions into the context folder as separate code files. Always maintain a clear code hierarchy through file structures. (Try to limit each code file to be **under 300-400 lines** including comments)

Create `/context-a/myRegionalA.js` like this:
```
//myRegionalA.js
(function(app) {
    app.view({
        name: 'MyRegionalA',
        template: '...',
        [navRegion: '...',] 
        data: '...',
        coop: '...',
        actions: '...',
        [events: ...],
        onReady(): function(){
            //...
        }
    });
})(Application);
```

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** You can nest *Views*s with the `view=""` attributes in the template. Only named views can be refered by the `view=` attribute on an HTML tag in template.
!!!

You can define non-regional (un-named) views through the `Application.view()` API:
```
var CustomView = app.view({
    template: '...',
    //...
});
```
The above call to `app.view()` returns a **definition**. If you want an **instance** to be returned, do it like this:
```
...
var view = app.view({...}, true);
...
```

##### Template

Remember, when defining template for a view you can use one of the four ways we support: 

- \#id
- @\*\*/\*.html
- 'html string'
- ['html string' array]

Now, we've sketched the layout of our application, you might want more contexts defined before continue but that's the easy part, just repeat Step 1-2 till you are ready to proceed to light-up the views dynamically with remote data.

#### Step 4. Handling data

Though we do not agree with *Backbone*'s way of loading and persisting data through *Model/Collection*s. We do agree that **data** should be the central part of every computer program. In our case, the remote data from server are still used to power the dynamic views. We use *Backbone.Model/Collection* only when there is a *View*. In other words, *data* and *View*s are centric in our framework paradigm, *Model/Collection*s are not. Try to think of them as a integrated part of *View*s. 

##### Within a View

Use the `data` property and `.set()/get()/refresh()` methods.
```
(function(app) {
    app.view({

        data: '...', //can be 'url', {} or []

    });
})(Application);
```
If you put in an url, `app.remote()` will be called internally. The view will be shown with data rendered.

Note that in your template, if your data is an array, it is referenced by `{{items}}``.

```
view.set() - will always re-render the view if data changes;
view.get() - get all data or per key
view.refresh() - re-fetch data if needed and re-render;
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** When using the `.data` property on a view or using `view.set()`, the template will be re-rendered and trigger the `ready` event again. This is also true if a view happens to be an SVG canvas (`view.svg:true`), so that we can easily re-draw through `onReady()`. But, if the view happens to be a Form (`view.editors:{...}`), the template will **NOT** be re-rendered, only the editors will be reset by the data. This is to say that, data and data change will only affect presentation in none SVG/Form views. The special case with Form views can be thought as if the editors *intercepted* the given data before it can be passed to the template.
!!!

##### With app.remote()

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Use normal `$.ajax()` calls for **NON-API** resources such as static `.json` files. You don't want to pick up `Application.config.baseAjaxURI` in these situations. Further, you should specify `dataType: 'json'` in your `$.ajax()` call configure explicitly for loading `*.json` files so that the data can be returned as expected locally on mobile platforms. (When there isn't a web server, `$.ajax()` get `*.json` files into text strings instead of parsed Javascript object due to incorrect MIME type.)
!!!

Our recommended way of loading/persisting remote data is through:
```
//returns the $.ajax() object - jqXHR for using promises.
Application.remote('...url...' or {
    url: '...'
    params/querys: {...}, //converts to request parameters in header e.g ?a=1&b=2
    payload: {...}, //data to send to the server
    ..., //normal $.ajax options excluding `type`, `data`, `processData` and `contentType`
});
```
This method will intelligently guess which of the four HTTP method to use for each request according to the options passed. Here is some examples:
```
//GET: /abc
Application.remote('abc');

//GET: /abc?x=1&y=2
Application.remote({
    url: 'abc',
    params/querys: {
        x: 1,
        y: 2
    }
});
Application.remote('abc', null, {params/querys: {x: 1, y: 2}});

//GET: /user/1/details
Application.remote('user/1/details');
Application.remote('user', null, {_id: 1, _method: 'details'});

//POST: /user
Application.remote({
    url: 'user',
    payload: {...} //without _id
});
Application.remote('user', {...payload w/o _id...});

//PUT: /user/1
Application.remote({
    url: 'user',
    payload: { _id: 1, ...} //non-empty + _id
});
Application.remote('user', {...payload w/ _id...});

//DELETE: /user/1
Application.remote({
    url: 'user',
    payload: { _id: 1 } //just _id
});
Application.remote('user', {_id: 1});

```
It is recommended to handle the callbacks through promises on the returned jqXHR object:
```
Application.remote(...)
    .done(function(){...})
    .fail(function(){...})
    .always(...);
```

Data returned should be in the [JSON](http://json.org/) format and with `Content-Type: application/json` in its response headers. 


### Actions

Actions are click-ables marked by `action=""` attribute in your view template. The original way of registering events and listeners introduced by *Backbone.View* are flexible but tedious and repetitive. We offer you the **Action Tags** for speeding things up.

Any *View* can have its actions configure block activated like this (2 easy steps):
```
//myRegionalA.js
(function(app) {
    app.view({
        name: 'MyRegionalA', 
        ...,
        template: [
            '<div>',
                '<span class="btn" action="opA" lock="oplock">Do it!</span>', //1. mark action tag(s).
                ...,
            '</div>',
        ],
        ...,
        actions: { //2. implement the action listeners.
            _bubble: false | true, //bubble un-matched click event up. [default: false]
            'opA': function($triggerTag, e, lock){
                //do something here...
                ...
                app.unlock(lock); //lock = "oplock"
            },
            'opB': ...
        }
    });
})(Application);
```
Note that only 'single-click' actions can be registered like this at the moment. As you can see from the example, optionally, you can lock the action tags with topic based application locks through the `lock="..."` attribute.

Use `_bubble: true` if you want the click event to **propagate** to the parent view/container. `e.preventDefault()` needs to be specified in the action listeners if you don't want a clicking on `<a href="#xyz" action="another"></a>` tag to affect the navigation.

If you have locked the application with `Application.lock()` then the actions will not respond until the application becomes available again. This constrain is stronger than topic based locking throught the `lock="your lock name"` attribute on action tags.

!!!callout callout-warning
**Heads up**: Don't forget to unlock your lock, if specified through the `lock="..."` attribute, at the bottom of your action listener. 
!!!

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** You can use `lock="*"` to lock the application globally.
!!!

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** You can also use `unlock="..."` attribute to unlock the app or certain topic/action, this is in case that you want a pair of *Start/Stop* controls with app locking/unlocking splited into the 2 actions. 
!!!

### Events

Some interactions demand **collaboration** between view objects, this is why we introduce the concept of meta-event programming. 
```
//register
app.view([Optional Name], {
    //...
    coop: ['eventA', 'eventB'],
    //...
    onEventA: function(options){

    }
})

//later to trigger the collaboration
app.coop('eventA', options);
```

It is like coding through interfaces in a object-oriented programming language but much more flexible. The goal is to let the developer code with events instead of APIs so the implementation can be delayed as much as possible. The underlying principle is very simple:
```
//event format : namespace:worda-wordb-...
object.trigger('object:meta-event', arguments);
//will invoke listener : onWordaWordb...
object.onMetaEvent(arguments);
```
We have `Application (app:)`, `Context (context:)` and all the `View (view:)` enhanced to accept meta-event triggers. Some of the events are already listened/triggered for you:

**Application** -- app:meta-event
```
//bootstraping
app:before-mainview-ready //fired before the application is shown
app:mainview-ready //fired after the application is shown

//navigation
app:navigate (string) or ({context:..., module:...}, silent) - Application.onNavigate [pre-defined]
app:context-guard-error (error, contextName) - [pre-defined]
app:context-switched (contextName)  - [empty stub]

//the followings are triggered by Application.remote():
app:ajax - before ajax sent
app:ajax-start - single progress
app:ajax-stop - single progress
app:ajax-active - overall
app:ajax-inactive - overall

//triggered by window
app:resized - [empty stub]
app:scroll - [empty stub]

//global - for alerts and prompts
app:success - [empty stub]
app:error - [empty stub]

//lock related
app:locked - [empty stub] (action/options, lock/(n/a))
```
**Context** -- context:meta-event
```
context:before-navigate-to
context:navigate-chain 
context:navigate-away - [empty stub] - triggered before app:navigate
```
**View** -- view:meta-event
```
//General
view:ready 
    (same as view:show for static view)
    (same as view:data-rendered for data view)
    (same as view:editors-updated for form view)
    view:ready doesn't guarantee sub-region view ready.

//View with navRegion
view:navigate-chain
view:navigate-to
view:navigate-away (if parentCt persists)

//CollectionView only (Remote Data Pagination)
view:load-page
view:page-changed
```

Remember, you can always trigger a customized event `my-event-xyz` and implement it later on the object by creating `onMyEventXyz()`.

#### Use parentCt/Ctx/Region?

Before you move on, there is one more thing in this event section we want to clarify. Your sub-view instances within template regions will receive a `parentCt` property upon showing which should help you find their parent view instance.

This is helpful when you want to achieve **collaborations** between sub-views by using event managed by the parent.
```
//Good
subViewA {
	...
	parentCt.trigger('co-op-event', data, [options]);
	...
}
parentCt.onCoOp:
	subViewB = new SubViewB(data);
	regionB.show(subViewB);
	//or
	subViewB.trigger('co-op', data);

//Bad
subViewA.parentCt.regionB.show(subViewB);
subViewA {
	...
	subViewB.doCoOp(data)
	...
}
```

!!!callout callout-info
**Remember:** Always prefer *Events* over *APIs* while implementing collaborations.
!!!

Besides `parentCt`, views shown in regions will also get a ref to `parentCtx` and `parentRegion`.

### Locks

You can use a global lock to lock all UIs of your application, like this
```
//global lock
var successful = Application.lock(); 
Application.available(); //false
Application.unlock();
Application.available(); //true

//global lock 
var successful = Application.lock('*');
Application.available('*'); //false 
Application.unlock('*');
Application.available('*'); //true
```
!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Global lock will also **disable** your navigation.
!!!

Alternatively, you can choose to use topic based locking like we've introduced in the **Actions** section previously:
```
//topic based lock
var successful = Application.lock('topic'); 
Application.available('topic'); //false
Application.unlock('topic');
Application.available('topic'); //true

Application.available('anything'); //true
Application.lock();
Application.lock('anything'); //false, since global lock is unavailable.
Application.available('anything'); //false, since global lock is unavailable.
```
!!!callout callout-info
**Remember:** You can't acquire topic locks if the global lock is currently unavailable.
!!!

### Graph (SVG canvas)

We support graphs through SVG. Use of SVG library (RaphaÃ«l.js/Snap.svg) is **optional**. After including the library (NOT in dependencies.min.js), You can use `this.paper` in any *View* through:
```
Application.view({
    svg: true,
    onReady: function(){
        //call .clear() first to re-init canvas.
        this.paper.clear();
        //draw...
    }
});
```
Don't worry about resizing, it is already prepared for you. The paper size will be set correctly to the containing region automatically. Just **DON'T forget** to call `this.paper.clear()` upon drawing and re-draw in your svg canvas.

If you require ready-made charts to be drawn, look through our monitored libraries under `/bower_components` there should be `d3/c3.js`, `Chart.js` and `peity` for exactly that.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** HTML5 *Canvas* is not supported at the moment, you can use `Easel.js` or `paper.js` on your own effort.
!!!

### UX

UX stands for user experience, it is not just about look'n'feel and clickings but also transitions/animations that links between interactions and state change. UX is hard to design, without a clear think-through over the purposes and targeted user tasks, it can be a total chaos... Make sure you have had your plan/sketch reviewed by targeted audience/friends or colleagues before implementation. Employ the *Goal-Directed Design* technique as much as you can.

#### Enter/Exit Effects

Both *region* and *View* can have an `effect` configure to control the effect through which it will be entering/exiting on a region:
```
//myRegionalA.js
(function(app) {
    app.view({
        name: 'MyRegionalA', 
        ...,
        effect: 'string' or
        {
            enter: '...',
            exit: '...'
        },
        ...
    });
})(Application);

//Or in the template
<div region="..." data-effect="..."></div>
<div region="..." data-effect-enter="..." data-effect-exit="..."></div>
```
Use the css animation class name you build or from the included *Animate.css* library.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** If you are using a single effect name for both entering and exiting effects, do **NOT** write `In` and `Out` at the end of the name as they will be added automatically for you.
!!!

Use `view.effect` to override region effects and `view.effect = false` to disable region effects.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** All region effects are from *Animate.css* but all $.plugin effects are from jQuery UI. (e.g `view.overlay() using $.fn.overlay()`)
!!!

!!!callout callout-warning
**Don't:**
* Create Model/Collection instances unless it is to generate views.
* Wrap/Organize your view definitions into Class hierarchies.
* Put more than 2 non-object params in any function signature.
* Use direct method invocations for view-view, view-application collaborations.
!!!


Form Editors
------------
We have already prepared the basic html editors for you in the framework. You don't have to code `<input>`, `<select>` or `<textarea>` in any of your view template. It is now very easy to build views to function as forms or to just add editors to views. 

You can also easily compose compound editors and fieldsets with the basic editors. This way you can reduce/combine values produced by the editors and collect them with a hierarchy/structure.

### Basic

You can activate basic editors in any *View* like this:
```
Application.view({
    ...,
    editors: { //editors per fieldname
        _global: {...}, //globally shared per editor configures

        abc: {
            type: 'text', //other types are available as well.
            label: 'Abc',
            help: 'This is abc',
            tooltip: 'Hey Abc here!',
            placeholder: 'abc...',
            value: 'default',
            validate: { //validators are executed in sequence:
                required: { //named validator
                    msg: 'Hey input something!', //options for the validator function
                    ...,
                },
                fn: function(val, parentCt){ //anonymous validator
                    if(!_.string.startsWith(val, 'A')) return 'You must start with an A';
                }
            }

        },
        ..., //other editor configures
    },
    ...
});
```
The editors will be appended inside the calling view instance one by one by default, or, by the `editor="[fieldname]"` position attribute in the view's template. They can also be placed according to its own `appendTo` configuration.


#### Configure

* appendTo - in case you don't have `editor="[fieldname]"` in your template and want to change where to put the editor other than the default position.
* parentCt - in case you want to delegate editor events to a parent container object (e.g a form object).
* type - text, password, url, email, checkbox(es), radios, file, hidden, ro (for read-only), textarea, select
* label
* help
* tooltip
* placeholder
* value - (default value)
* validate - (custom function or list of validators/rules)

#### Advanced configure

* layout 
 - label - css class (e.g col-sm-2)
 - field - css class (e.g col-sm-10)
* html: - indicating read-only text field (setting this will cause 'type' to be 'ro')
* options: (radios/selects/checkboxes only)
    * inline: true|false 
    * data: [] or {group:[], group2:[]} - (groups are for select only)
    * labelField
    * valueField
    * remote: app.remote() config for loading options.data remotely
* multiple - true|false (select only)
* rows - number (textarea only) 
* boxLabel: (single checkbox label other than field label.)
* checked: '...' - (checked value, single checkbox only)
* unchecked: '...' - (unchecked value, single checkbox only)
* upload:
    *  standalone: false/true - whether or not to display a stand-alone upload button for this field.
    *  formData: - an {} or function to return additional data to be submitted together with the file.
    *  fileInput: - a jQuery collection of input\[type=file\]\[name="file[]"\] objects. (for multi-file upload through one editor api)
    *  url - a string indicating where to upload the file to.
    *  ...  see complete option listing on [https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options].
    *  callbacks:
        *      done/fail/always/progress ... - see complete callback listing on [https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options].

Remember, you can always layout your editors in a *View* through the `editor=""` attribute in the template: 
```
template: [
    '<div editor="abc"></div>', //use fieldname to identify editor
    '<div editor="efg"></div>'
]
```

#### API and events

You will also get the following APIs attached to the **view** instance object once you have configured the `editors:{}` block:
```
this.getEditor(name); 
this.getValues(); //or this.get()
this.setValues(vals, loud); //or this.set()
this.validate(true|false); //true for showing the validation errors.
this.status(status, messages); //for highlighting status per editor. no arguments means to clear.
```

There are also events emitted that you can use when dealing with each of these editors:
```
editor:change
editor:keyup
editor:focusin // - focus
editor:focusout // - blur
```
If you use `options.parentCt` to pass in another view instance, the events will be fired on that view instance **in addition to** firing on the editor itself. It is useful when you want every event to be fired on a parent container or, say, a form view.

Each editor instance will have the following methods:
```
editor.getVal();
editor.setVal(val, loud);
editor.disable([flag]); //false to enable, default to disable, true to disable + hide.
editor.isEnabled();
editor.validate(showError); //if you have options.validator configured
editor.status(status, message); //info, error, warning, success status, empty to reset status.

//in addition, the file editor have a .upload() method
editor.upload({
    url: ...,
    formData: {...},
    fileInput: this.$el.find('input[name="files[]"]') //multi-files
});
//you can use this to trigger the upload process and submit additional data
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** The *select, radios and checkboxes* editors can be initialized without `options.data` configuration, these editors have an additional `setChoices()` API that you can use to set the available choices later. However it is recommended that you use the `options.remote` configure if the options data is from a remote data source.
!!!

#### Add your own

If you need more editors please register them through
```
Application.editor('[your editor name]', function(){
    var Editor = Application.view({...});
    ...;
    return Editor;
});
```
You need to provide the `getVal`, `setVal`, `validate`, `status` and `disable` (+`isEnabled`) methods.

!!!callout callout-warning
**Important:** Do *NOT* write `onShow/onReady` in your editor definition. Use `onRender` instead so that your editor can support the `editor=""` template attributes for dynamic positioning.
!!!

#### Validation

A custom validate function for an editor can be directly configured like this:
```
var Demo = app.view({

    editors: {
        ...,
        xyz: {
            type: '...',
            help: '...',
            validate: function(val, parentCt){ //parentCt points to this view
                if(val !== '123') return 'You must enter 123';
            }
        },
        ...
    }

});
```

You can also specify multiple validators and rules to use on the same editor:
```
var Demo = app.view({

    editors: {
        ...,
        xyz: {
            type: '...',
            help: '...',
            validate: {
                ruleA: {
                    //options to predefined rule A
                },

                ruleB: {
                    //...
                },

                fn1: function(val, parentCt){ //anonymous validator
                    //...
                },

                fn2: function(val, parentCt) {
                    //...
                },

                ...// more validators

            }
        },
        ...
    }

});
```

The validate function or validators should return **undefined or the 'error string'** to indicate passed and rejected situation respectively.

You can always register more named validators as rules by:
```
Application.editor.validator('my-validator-name', function(options, val, parentCt){
    ...,
});
```
alias: `Application.editor.rule()`.

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** We included the [`validator-js`](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) library for you in the framework through `dependencies.js`. You can use it as a base to implement your validations faster and easier.
!!!

### Compound

Sometimes you need to build a compound editor with more basic editors than the number of values collected. You can do this by assigning a view **definition** to the editor configure:
```
Application.view({

    editors: {
        a: ...,
        b: ...,

        c: Application.view({
            template: ...,
            editors: ..., //*required
            getVal: ..., //*required
            setVal: ..., //*required
            status: ... //*required if you want customized error message display.
        })
    }

});
```
This has some disadvantages compare to registering an new editor via `app.editor()`, but is more intuitive when defining a compound form editor.

If you still want `_global` (e.g appendTo) configure and `parentCt` (for editor events) to be passed to the editor, use `app.editor()` to register the view as a formal editor.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Compound editor has its child editors' eager validation feature disabled.
!!!

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** Configure your child editor without the `label` config option.
!!!

### Fieldset

With view instance easily turned into form now, you might want to nest form pieces with *View* and collect the values with similar hierarchy, this could be done by adding a `fieldset` property to your view definition besides the `editors` configuration:
```
var FieldsetX = Application.view({

    fieldset: 'sub-fieldset-x',
    editors: {
        ...
    }

});
```
Then, you can use the view as normal regional views in a parent view:
```
Application.view({

    template: [
        '<div region="fieldset-a"></div>',
        '<div></div>'
    ],
    editors: {
        ..., //itself can contain editors!
    },
    onReady: function(){
        this.getRegion('fieldset-a').show(new FieldsetX);
    }

})
```
Now, the values you collect from the parent view through `getValues()` will contain a field `sub-fieldset-x` with all the values collected from that fieldset view.

You can also control the nested editors through a dotted name path:
```
parent.getEditor('sub-fieldset-x.abc'); //will get you editor `abc` in targeted fieldset.
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Normally, if you don't need to collect values per group, you can omit the `fieldset` property in the view's definition. Values will be merged with those from the parent view.
!!!

### Build a form

As you can see from the above sections, you can build 2 types of forms through views:
* Basic/Piece
    * Just use the `editors:{}` configure block in a view definition.
* Nested
    * Use a view together with nested views into regions.
    * Name nested views with fieldset names to form a hierarchy if needs be.

In a nested form view, may there be fieldsets or not, you can always use these APIs in the outer-most view:
```
this.getValues(); 
this.setValues(vals, loud); 
this.validate(true|false); //true for showing the validation errors.
```
The above APIs will automatically go through the regional views as well, if they too have the same functions attached. This enables a way to progressively build a form view through regions and then still be used as a whole. 


Widgets
-------
To make your view definitions reusable, we offer a way of registering *Widget*s:
```
Application.widget('MyWidgetName', 
	function(){
		var UI = Application.view({...});
        ...;
		return UI;
	}
)
```
It is recommended to employ the **List'n'Container** technique when creating *Widget*s.

### Build your own

The *List'n'Container* technique is the golden technique to use when planning your reusable views or, say, any view on screen. Any widget on screen can be decoupled into lists and containers, like this:

![List'n'Containers](static/resource/default/diagram/Diagram-5.png)

* Starts by choosing a proper container with desired layout, nest containers if needs be.
* Put lists into the container.
* Figure out the view to show within each list item.

You can always nest another layer of container-list-item into an item of parent layer to form even more complex views. Make sure you use the `Application.view(options)` API when defining the list item views.

**Suggestions**: 
* Always implement the `view:reconfigure` meta event listeners in a widget for swapping data and configuration after the widget is shown.
* Keep widgets reconfigurable in display and dumb in functionality, don't put *policy* code as logic into them. 
* Leave space to accommodate real case usages by keeping options minimum. Don't turn into an *all-in-one* thing and force other developers to *configure* the widget.
* Fire event whenever an action is triggered, provide a default listener so that later it can be rewired.
* Test your widget in designed scenarios thoroughly with mock-up data.

To assist you further in the development process, we have several pre-implemented lightweight widgets bundled into the release as well, let's examine them. 


### Datagrid

**Purpose**: Give you a dynamic `<table>` with columns and customizable cells.

**Options**:
```
data: [{key: val, key2: val2, ...}, {}] - //array of data objects
columns: 
[
    {
        name: //a key string in the data object
        header: //default: 'string' (e.g 'string' maps to 'StringHeaderCell')
        cell: //default: same as header (e.g 'string' maps to 'StringCell')
        label: //name given to header cell, default: _.titleize(name)
    },
    ...
]
```

**Usage**: 3 possible scenarios
```
...
//Scenario 1. configured
this.show('region', 'Datagrid', {
    className: 'table table-hover',

    data: Mock.mock(mockDataTpl).data, //optional, you can put data into the grid later.
    columns: [
        {
            name: '_id',
            label: '#',
            cell: 'seq'
        },
        {
            name: 'username',
            icon: 'fa fa-envelope'
        },
        {
            name: 'profile.name',
            label: 'Name'
        },
        {
            name: 'profile.age',
            label: 'Age'
        },
        {
            name: 'link'
        },
        {
            cell: 'action',
            //label: 'Ops',
            icon: 'fa fa-cog',
            actions: {
                edit: {
                    //action listeners are bound to the row
                    fn: function(){
                        //record, columns
                        console.log(this.model, this.collection);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
...

//Scenario 2. feed data into the grid after it is shown:
var datagrid = this.region.currentView;
datagrid.set([...data...]);

//Scenario 3. re-configure the columns and cells:
datagrid.trigger('view:reconfigure', {...new config options...});
});
```

**Operate on a row**
```
var table = new Datagrid();
table.on('row:clicked', function(row){...});
table.on('row:dblclicked', function(row){...});

or
otherView.listenTo(table, 'row:clicked', function(row){...});
otherView.listenTo(table, 'row:dblclicked', function(row){...});
```

**Extend columns**:
```
;(function(app){

//make a new cell: -- cell: string,
    app.widget('StringCell', function(){

        var UI = app.view({
            template: '<span>{{{value}}}</span>',
            initialize: function(options){
                //options.row is the row view object this cell is on
                //options.model is the column config + index & value
                ...
            }      
        });

        return UI;
    });

//make a new header cell: -- header: string,
    app.widget('StringHeaderCell', function(){

        var UI = app.view({
            template: '<span><i class="{{icon}}"></i> {{{label}}}</span>',
            initialize: function(options){
                //options.model is the column config
                ...
            }             
        });

        return UI;
    });

})(Application);
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Don't forget to name your cells according to the naming convention. You don't have to give `tagName:td` or `tagName:th` to the cell definitions. Define them like normal views.
!!!

**Built-in Cells**
* action
* seq
* string

If you want to get hold of the outer datagrid view instance from a cell, reference it like this
```
    app.widget('YourOwnCell', function(){

        var UI = app.view({
            template: '...',
            initialize: function(options){

                this.grid = options.row.grid;
                //where grid.body is the table rows,
                //grid.header is the header row;

            }      
        });

        return UI;
    });
```

**Built-in Headers**
* string


### Tree

**Purpose**: Give you a nested tree list with customizable node template and selection events:
```
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li> -- node
        <a></a> -- item data
        <ul>...</ul> -- children
    </li>
    ...
</ul>
```

**Options**:
```
data: [{
            attr1: ...,
            attr3: ...,
            attrX: ...,
            children: [{
                attr1: ...,
                attr3: ...,
                children: [...]
            }, ..., {...}]
        }, ..., {
            attr1: ...,
            attr2: ...,
            attr3: ...
        }],
node: {...}, - //custom node definition (standard View config)
onSelected: callback(meta, $el, e){
    meta - //meta data about the selected node
    $el - //node view's $el
    e - //the click event
}
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** You can *NOT* change sub-node array key to be other than 'children' at the moment. Other than the 'children' field, any named field can appear in the data as node properties. Add the names into the node template to display them.
!!!

The default node template is like this:
```
template: [
    '<a class="item" href="#">',
        '<i class="type-indicator"></i> <i class="{{icon}}"></i> {{{val}}}',
    '</a>',
    '<ul class="children hidden"></ul>' //tree nodes default on collapsed
]
```
So your data should have 'icon' and 'val' in each node's property.

**Usage**:
```
...
this.show('body', 'Tree', {
    data: [...],
    onSelected: function(meta, $el, e){
        e.preventDefault();
        console.debug(meta.view.model, $el);
    }
});
...
```
Note that, the default implementation supports automatically expand/collapse on tree nodes upon clicking.

**Extend**:
Use options.node to alter the node views:
```
...
node: {
    template: ..., 
}
...
```
Just like define a new view.

**Traverse**:
Each node will have the following data hooked into its $el
* view - view object of this $el
* $children
* $parent

You can use these to traverse the tree and extract needed information:
```
//back-track to parent's parent
nodeView.$el.data('$parent').data('$parent');
...
```


### Paginator

**Purpose**: To be used with any CollectionView for jumping between pages.

**Options**:
```
target: //the view object it binds to [optional]
currentPage: //current page number
totalPages: //total pages in number
pageWindowSize: //visible number of page indices (default to 5)
```

**Usage**:
```
...
var table = tableRegion.currentView;
this.show('footer', 'Paginator', {
    target: table.getBody(),
    className: 'pagination pagination-sm pull-right'
});
...
```
Activate pagination through the `view:load-page` meta-event in a *CollectionView*:
```
//continue
table.getBody().trigger('view:load-page', {
    url: '/sample1/user',
    page: 1,
    querys: {
        status: 'active'
    }
});
```
The `view:page-changed` event emitted by the table will bring `currentPage` and `totalPages` into the paginator widget.

**view:load-page**

This event can start a pagination enabled data loading process in any *CollectionView* instance.
```
CollectionView.trigger('view:load-page', {
    page: 1,
    pageSize: 15,
    dataKey: 'payload',
    totalKey: 'total',
    ..., - rest of app.remote() options
})

//events that comes after the data/response arrives
//'view:load-page-done' - default implementation provided
//'view:load-page-fail' - empty stub
//'view:load-page-always' - empty stub
```
Use the additional events or override the default implementations to customize your own page loading logic for *CollectionView*s.


### Overlay

jQuery plugin

**Purpose**: Provide you a way of overlaying custom content/views on screen.

**Options**:
```
effect: //'jquery ui effects string', can be specifics:
    openEffect: ...,
    closeEffect: ...,
content: //'text'/html or el or a function($el, $overlay) that returns one of the three.
onShow: //function($el, $overlay) - show callback;
onClose: //function($el, $overlay) - close callback;
class: //'class name strings for styling purposes';
move: true|false - //whether or not to make the overlay-container draggable through jquery ui.
resize: true|false - //whether or not to make the overlay-container resizable through jquery ui.
```

**Usage**:
```
//show overlay
$('body').overlay({
    content: app.view({...}, true).render()
});

//close it
$('body').overlay();
$('body').overlay(false, {
    effect: {...}
})
```

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Repeatedly open overlays on the same $(el) will have no effect. Close the previous one first. There are also 3rd-party libraries available for creating simple overlays over `<a>` and `<img>` tags (e.g [colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/)).
!!!

**Short-cut**: Use with custom views
```
var view = Application.view({
    ...,
    overlay: true or {
        ... //normal $.overlay configure without (content, onClose)
    },
    ...
}, true);

view.overlay({
    anchor: '...', //default 'body' - css selector
});

view.close(); //this will close the overlay as well;
```
This is the recommended way of using custom views as overlays.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** After closing the overlayed view, remember to re-new it before showing as overlay again.
!!!

### ToC (Table-of-Content)

jQuery plugin

**Purpose**: Produce a table-of-content tree list in both html and json format for a given document (through `<h1>`-`<h6>` title relationship scanning)

**Options**:
```
ignoreRoot: false | true - //whether to ignore h1
headerHTML: //html before ul (sibling) - experimental

 * Document h-tag classes
 * ----------------------
 * h1 -- book title
 * h2 -- chapters
 * h3 -- sections
 * ...
```

**Usage**:
```
$el.toc({
    ignoreRoot: true,
    headerHTML: '<div class="h4" style="margin-top:48px"><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Table of Content</div>'
});
```
This will produce the html version into `$el.data('toc').html`

**Display**:
```
that.toc.show(Application.view({
    //use the generated html as another view's template
    template: $el.data('toc').html,
    actions: {
        goTo: function($btn, e){
            e.preventDefault();
            that.trigger('view:go-to-topic', $btn.data('id'));
        }
    }
}, true));
```


i18n/l10n
---------
Internationalization/Localization is always a painful process, making substitution dynamically to the strings and labels appear in the application according to the user locale settings can interfere with the coding process if every string is to be coded with a `getResource('actual string')` wrapped around.

Luckily, JavaScript is a prototypical language, we can extend the `String` class through its prototype and give every string a way of finding its own translation.

### Cast i18n on strings

To use the i18n mechanism in your application, simply add `.i18n()` to the tail of your string:
```
//directly
'String to be translated'.i18n()
//indirectly by auto type cast
var s = 'Another string to translate';
s.i18n()
```
You can also use it in template as a *Handlebars.js* helper:
```
template: [
    '<div>',
        '{{i18n \'key\'}}', //this will translate whatever string the var 'key' is holding
    '<div>'
]
```
If you need to cast i18n on a block of text, we suggest that you use our $.md jQuery plugin and manage blocks of text and their translations in separate markdown files. If you are really in a hurry, you can also use our i18n mechanism as a jQuery plugin:
```
<div>
    <span data-i18n-key="*">abcd...</span>
    <span data-i18n-key="efg">abcd...</span>
</div>

$('span').i18n();
$('div').i18n({search: true}); //if you want to use parent container to cast
```
Remember to use the `data-i18n-key` attribute to identify the content of a tag for translation. If you want to use the entire content text as a *big* key for the translation, use `data-i18n-key="*"`. If you use `data-i18n-key="efg"` to identify a tag, its content will be translated as if you were using string `efg`.

### Translation file

The translation files are needed to complete the i18n mechanism. We use a simple opt-in way of loading resource file for a given locale:
```html
http(s)://your host'n'app/?locale=xx-XX
```
The query param **locale** in the url will tell the i18n mechanism to load a specific resource file.

#### Format

Your translation file should be in the [JSON](http://json.org/) format, like this:
```javascript
{
    locale: 'xx-XX',
    trans: {
        "string": "translation", 
        //or 
        "string": {
           "_default": "", //the default translation if not specifying namespace
           "namespace-a": "",
           "namespace-b": "",
           "senario-x": "",
           "module-y": ""
        },
        ..., //other key-trans pairs
    }
}
```
Note that, we allow you the freedom to translate the same string into different things according to module/namespace/senario settings. You can activate a module/namespace/senario translation like this:
```javascript
//directly in javascript
'String to translate'.i18n({module: 'module/namespace/senario'});
```

```html
//or in a Handlebar.js template
<span>{{i18n key module}}</span>

//or as jQuery plugin
<span data-i18n-key="*" data-i18n-module="module-y">abc</span>
```
```javascript
//then
$('span').i18n();
```


### Configuration

You can configure where and what the i18n mechanism need to look for its required translation files through the I18N global variable:
```
//a. through Application
Application.setup({
    ...,
    i18nResources: 'static/resource',
    i18nTransFile: 'i18n.json',
    ...
});

//or b. through I18N global
I18N.configure({
    resourcePath: 'static/resource',
    translationFile: 'i18n.json' // => 'static/resource/{locale}/i18n.json'
    //or
    translationFile: '{locale}.json' //=> 'static/resource/{locale}.json'
    translationFile: '[any string]{locale}[any string].json'
});
```
The default settings will always look for `http://your host/static/resource/{locale}/i18n.json`.

### Gather keys at runtime

When the application is running in browser, you can fire-up the developer console and call the following APIs on the `I18N` object to collect the translation keys:
```
//get all i18n keys and trans rendered in the app in "key" = "val" format;
I18N.getResourceProperties(untransedOnly) 

//get the above listing in JSON format;
I18N.getResourceJSON(untransedOnly, encode=true)
//or
app.i18n() //encode=false

//check translation;
app.i18n(key, ns)

//insert translations
app.i18n({...}) //'key': {'ns1': 'trans1', ...} or 'trans'
```
You can use `untransedOnly = true` in the above functions if you only want to get un-translated entries. This is a great way of collecting un-translated strings  for your localizer (by simply go through the application views).

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** If your view hasn't been shown in the application, the i18n keys for that view can not be collected by the above functions.
!!!


Themes
------

!!!callout callout-danger
**Deprecated:** Dynamic Theme Rolling is now deprecated on the client side. Please specify your theme `main.css` directly in `index.html`.
!!!

Please use the `themeprep` tool to create and refresh your themes. Note that you don't have to use the tool to regenerate the theme each time your change your `*.less` files. Your `devserver` automatically watches and recompiles the `*.less` files for you.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** Only invoke the theme tool when you add new fonts or images to an old theme, or creating a new theme.
!!!

### Theme structure

Themes are located at `/implementation/themes/[your theme name]/` with the following structure:
> * /css
>     - main.css -- do *NOT* change this one directly
> * /fonts -- prepared by the themeprep tool
> * /img
>     - /texture -- these will/should not be included in the css-spirte
>     - /icons
>     - /pics
>     - /logo
> * /less
>     - img.less -- prepared by the themeprep tool (textures, icons & logos)
>     - mixins.less -- style short-cuts
>     - vars.less -- base variable override
>     - components.less -- framework Widgets/Editors/Plugins/Containers style
>     - main.less -- always start with this file

Open up the `themes/default/less/main.less` file and read the details about how to modify the default theme bundled with the starter-kit distribution. The `bower` distribution only contains a built version of the default theme.

### Theme preparation

Use `/tools/themeprep` to prepare your theme with required fonts and images (icons, texture, logo and pics). This tool will create required folders and copy needed fonts for you. It will also combine css-sprite from the image folders each time you run it and produce `img.less` to be included in your `main.less`.

```
stagejs theme [your theme name] - default on 'project'
```

### Create image CSS-Sprite

If you put images (e.g *.png icon files) into the `img` folder, the `themeprep` tool will create an image CSS-Sprite for you together with a .less ready to use. A demo page is also generated to display all the images/icons.
```
stagejs theme <your theme name>
```

### Change to other Fonts

* Manually or use the `-F` or `--fonts` option in the `themeprep` tool to copy the fonts into `/fonts`.
* Change `main.less` to include the related font style .less file.
* Change `vars.less` to override the font base path if needed and change `@font-family-base` to include prefered font-family names.

```
stagejs theme <your theme name> -F fontawesome,bootstrap,...
```

### LESS to CSS

(What's [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)?)

The `main.less` loads/glues all the above files and compiles into main.css, you do not need to compile the included .less files separately and put the compiled .css back into the `main.less`. The statically inlined css files are those that we want to copy into the compiled main.css without any change.

In any .less file you can @include (to merge with, to have) other .less/.css files and you can define styles using LESS or css as well. That's why `bootstrap.less` loads other style definition files but doesn't have its own definition, it is used solely as a glue file. `variables.less` is another extreme, it only contains LESS vars to be reused in other style definition files so you can override the basic styles with ease later.

One perk of using LESS is that you can define each .less to do only one thing, e.g:
* vars.less - to define reusable css codes into variables;
* component.less - use styles loaded/defined in static.less/vars.less to define new css styles in a nested class format;
* main.less - glue(@include) the above .less files and let the compiler compile into main.css;

Tools
-----
It is recommended to install the [Stagejs-devtools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stage-devtools) and use the command-line for building, serving and theming your project instead of calling them manually.

### Build & Deploy

Type in this command in console/terminal to build:
```
stagejs build dist
```
Find your built deployment under /tools/build/dist.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** You might need to change the `config.dist.js` file if you want to include more files in deployment.
!!!

By default, the command will look for `config.dist.js` and construct your deployment folder `dist` with folders and files accordingly.

Also by default, the build tool will grab the targeted index.html indicated by `config.dist.js` and scan through all the `<script>` tags to collect and combine the js codes.

Type this command to get more from the build tool:
```
stagejs build -h
```


### Development Server

Under `/tools/devserver`, we provide you with a development web server that could help you serve both the `/implementation` folder and your built deployments. It can also monitor your theme folders and automatically compile `main.less` into `main.css`.

**Start**
```
stagejs serve [port:5000]
```

**Configure**

Please see `/tools/devserver/profile/default.js`

**Extend**

You can add more bots, profiles and most importantly routers into the server. Just add them into the folders respectively, they will be automatically loaded. Routers added will be mounted and available for all web roots.

!!!callout callout-primary
**Note:** By design, we only introduced *bots*(init/helper routines), *profiles*(configures), *middlewares*, *routers* and *channels* into the development server stack, you can also add *dbs* and other stuff into the server.
!!!

Read more about [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [express-load](https://github.com/jarradseers/express-load) so you can make full use of this development server.


FAQs
----
### Include other js libraries

The default `dependences.js` contains carefully (minimum) selected libraries for your project, if you would like to introduce more, use [bower](http://bower.io/) and the `bower.json` file included.
Go into `/implementation` and run `bower install` to grab all the monitored 3rd-party libraries.

Include your libraries after `dependences.js` in `/implementation/index.html`.

You can also use our devtools to do that:
```
stagejs lib install <lib name on bower>
stagejs lib use <lib name on bower>
```

!!!callout callout-info
**Tip:** Alternatively, you can always use a *CDN* (Content Delivery Network) to load the JavaScript libraries into your index.html (e.g [jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/)) However, this will affect the build process since these libraries will not be combined if they are not from local.
!!!

### Initialize/Update project

Start developing and keep your project up-to-date is made easy with the command-line devtools. You can install it through `npm`:
```
npm -g install stage-devtools
```
After installation, you can start using the tool with a globally available command `stagejs`:
```
stagejs env
stagejs init
stagejs update [--edge]
...
```
Read more about this cli tool [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stage-devtools).

### What should I put in `/static`?

`/resource` should contain static resources per locale. (per xx-XX folder, `/default` for locale independent)

### Developing for Full-Screen?

To develop your app to be full-screen, first setup the application to be in full-screen mode:
```
Application.setup({
    fullScreen: true,
    ...
});
```
This will keep the `<body>` tag to be 100% on both its width and height to the browser window and set its `overflow-y/x` to `hidden`.

### View size measurement error?

The dynamic theme loading mechanism (deprecated) will potentially race with size measuring in views' `onReady()` functions. This is mainly caused by modern browser's ability to multi-threading CSS rendering and JavaScript execution. Make sure you specify theme css in your `index.html`.
```
//index.html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="themes/[your theme]/main.css">
```

### Need tabs in the UI?

Tabs are not widgets, they may contain widget(s). This is why we didn't include them in the base widget collection. You can always start a new view with proper templating to enable tabs (see [Bootstarp.Tabs](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs))

Remember, use tabs as last resort and only in templates, do *NOT* use dynamic tabs and manage them using Javascript.

### Need recursively rendered tree-like View?

It is recommended to use the built-in **Tree** widget rather than building recursive views yourself.

### Supporting crossdomain ajax?

Yes, if you need client-side crossdomain ajax calls, you can supply the `xdomain` option to your ajax requests:
```
$.ajax({
    ...,
    xdomain: {
        protocal: 'http'/'https',
        host: ...,
        port: ...,
        headers: {
            'X-User': ...,
            'X-Pwd': ...,
            'X-Token': ...,
            ... //any thing that can represent a credential.
        },
    },
    ...
});
