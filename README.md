[Change Log](CHANGELOG.md) - What's changed?

To get version, type `app.stagejs` in the console. Example output:
```
app.stagejs (1.8.x-<commits> build <timestamp>)
```
You can compare this version number with the one you see on the [documentation site](http://bluekvirus.github.io/Stage.js/#navigate/Document) and see if an upgrade is recommended.

**Announcement**: We are working on a fully upgraded live demo/document site for the v1 branch. We are also working on the v2 branch development. A complete feature listing is available. ([v2 plan](#whats-next)). Please note that v1 will **NOT be abandoned** even if v2 is released, they are different tech directions. v2 will be called `-ng`.

> <sup>\*</sup>The v1 branch serves as a benchmark for creating tests for features and for feedback gathering. We have now successfully released 6 web/cloud products offering intuitive control panels, complex monitoring dashboards, online/offline reports and excellent user interactions with full localization support through the v1 branch. More will come. 

This project produces **Stage.js** - an infrastructure for building modern web application client with different contexts (e.g a data-heavy administration app). In other words, we solve this problem for you:

Quick Start
------------
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/stage-devtools"><img src="http://img.shields.io/npm/v/stage-devtools.svg?style=flat-square" alt="DevTools Version"></img></a> 

Use the devtools to get started quickly.
```
npm -g install stage-devtools
mkdir project
cd project
stagejs init
stagejs serve [--port <number>]
```
You can now start developing your app with Stage.js. Read the [command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stage-devtools) for more.


Documentation
-------------
Again, as an application developer you are encouraged read this [documentation](http://bluekvirus.github.io/Stage.js/#navigate/Document)

Contribute
----------
Fork/Clone the project and tweak the code locally, then contribute by making a pull request so you can push the change in.

###Prepare
After cloning the project, you should go to `/tools` and run these commands:
```
//1. prepare npm packages
npm install

//2. prepare bower packages
./lib-update.sh

//3. prepare default & doc site theme packs (under ./themeprep)
node run default
node run site --fonts bootstrap,open-sans-fontface,fontawesome

//4-1 fire up dev server (background logging)
./start.sh

//4-2 fire up dev server (foreground logging)
npm start
```
This should fire-up the development server. It will serve the `/implementation` folder as web root on the port define by `/tools/devserver/profile/default`. Please go check the content of this profile config file before starting. It has some nice middlewares and auto-change-detectors there you can switch on/off to make the development a lot easier.

###Develop, Demo & Tryout
Change code under `/implementation/js/src` to test and contribute your ideas to this framework.

You can also change the code under `/implementation/site`, it is the application for **Stage.js**'s documentation site.

Look closely to the `/implementation/index.html` file, it not only defines the loading sequence of all the src files but also defines which one goes to which build target in the build process.

###Modify theme
Please go check the `/implementation/themes/default` basic theme package and follow instructions in the `/less/main.less` over there. You can easily switch to use other base themes offered by [bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) (based on Bootstrap 3) to quickly build up your own.

You can always refresh existing theme or start a new one by using the theme-prep tool under `/implementation/tools/themeprep`.

###Commit Info
Use the following `git` command to see some brief info about repo commits
```
git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline -n 5
git rev-list HEAD --count
```


Distribute
----------
###Build
```
//0. change version numbers
a. CHANGELOG.md and tools/libprep/bower.json
//numbers in README.md, HOWTO.md are updated automatically.

//1. [optional] update libs & bower release version
tools/lib-update.sh

//2. [optional] update themes (under tools/themeprep/)
//**Stop the devserver by using `./stop.sh` under `tools` first!**
node run 
node run site

//3. build distributions & doc site
tools/build.sh
```
**Important**: If you see any of the `*.less` file contains `@import url("...")` remove them before you compile the theme. Try to bring that piece to local code base. (e.g Host the web font yourself.)

###Deploy
See in `tools/build/dist` and `dist` for details. The shortcut command also builds the project site (as its github page).
